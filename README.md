# avaj_launcher - Frankfurt Airport Landing Track Simulator

The Frankfurt Airport recently discovered that frequent weather changes cause bottlenecks on some of their landing tracks. To find a solution, they need to know which scenarios create the worst bottlenecks. They decided to use a simulator where they can configure and analyze multiple scenarios to identify the root of the problem.

The Frankfurt Airport team has reached out to our top software shop to develop this simulator. The chief designer has worked on the concept and provided us with the following:

- UML class diagram
- Object-Oriented design patterns to use (Observer, Singleton, Factory)

To work on this project, you should have knowledge of:

- Interpreting class diagrams
- Observer, Singleton, and Factory design patterns
- Basic Java syntax and core features

Object-Oriented Design and design patterns are extensive topics that require extensive study, so feel free to explore these domains to discover a new way of thinking about software engineering.

For this project, only a good implementation will be accepted. The Frankfurt Airport team expects a clean design that is easy to read and understand by your peers and easy to modify if the requirements change.

## Usage

- Install Java
- Download and unzip the project files
- Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory
- Run `javac Main.java` to compile the program
- Run `java Main` to start the simulator
